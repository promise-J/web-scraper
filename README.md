### Prerequisites

Since all the code is written using ruby, `Ruby Runtime >= 1.9` is required to interpret the code. If you don't have ruby runtime already setup on your computer, follow the instruction for your specific operating system on the [official installation guide](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/). **Internet Connection is a must, for successful scraping**

### Usage

After cloning on your computer, open the folder using your terminal/command prompt window and run

`bin/main.rb`

### Web Scraping :: Introduction
Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites. Web scraping software may access the World Wide Web directly using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or through a web browser. [read-more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping). 

### Why I chose this scraper
I chose to scrape [this website](https://thenationonlineng.net) because I love reading news and one partaining to the nation Nigeria. However, I dedicate this to my sister who love journalism.

### How to use the Scraper
- The app scrapes a webpage consisting of the Nigeria online national news, their categories with the links respectively.
- It should display the result on the terminal.



*Note: The app requires internet connection for successful scraping!*
